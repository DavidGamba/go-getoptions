= Directed Acyclic Graph Build System

Lightweight Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Build System.

It allows building a list of tasks and then running the tasks in different DAG trees.

The tree dependencies are calculated and tasks that have met their dependencies are run in parallel.
There is an option to run it serially for cases where user interaction is required.

== Usage

A detailed example can be found in link:../examples/dag/main.go[]

To see what the build system would do run:

----
$ go run main.go build --quiet --dot

digraph G {
        label = "build graph";
        rankdir = TB;
        "bt3";
        "bt1";
        "bt3" -> "bt1";
        "bt2";
        "bt3" -> "bt2";
}
----

----
$ go run main.go clean --quiet --dot

digraph G {
        label = "clean graph";
        rankdir = TB;
        "ct1";
        "ct3";
        "ct1" -> "ct3";
        "ct2";
        "ct2" -> "ct3";
}
----

----
$ go run main.go
SYNOPSIS:
    main [--dot] [--help|-?] [--quiet] <command> [<args>]

COMMANDS:
    build    build project artifacts
    clean    clean project artifacts
    help     Use 'main help <command>' for extra details.

OPTIONS:
    --dot        Generate graphviz dot diagram (default: false)

    --help|-?    (default: false)

    --quiet      (default: false)

Use 'main help <command>' for extra details.
exit status 1

== Motivation

I want something better than Bash scripts and Makefiles but not as limiting as Bazel, Buck and Please (never tried Pants but they are all inspired by Blaze).
Scons and Gradle are hard to work with.

Mage is awesome but the first thing I saw a developer do with it was run it in a debugger which is not possible with the current design.
Mage builds a separate go file that it then compiles and runs. It also relies on panic/recover for its control flow.

This build system leverages go-getoptions and a DAG tree to provide an alternative.

== Build System

In order to have a build system you need a couple of pieces:

* Define task dependencies (This package takes care of that).
It builds a tree for you that it then runs in parallel when possible.

* Define target and sources dependencies.
In other words, if my sources have changed I need to rebuild my targets.
(That is in the works in another place, in the meanwhile use mage's https://github.com/magefile/mage/blob/master/target/target.go[target package].

* Task idempotency.
This so you can run your build system tasks over and over without risk.
This one is on you!
