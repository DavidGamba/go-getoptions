= Build

Lightweight build system inspired by Magefile.

It tracks inputs and outputs for modification and allows to parallelize tasks by defining dependencies.

I want something better than Bash scripts and Makefiles but not as limiting as Bazel, Buck and Please (never tried Pants but they are all inspired by Blaze).
Scons and Gradle are hard to work with.

Mage is awesome but the first thing a member of our team tried to do with it was run it in a debugger.
Mage builds a separate go file that it then compiles and run.
It also relies on panic/recover for its control flow.

This system leverages go-getoptions to provide an alternative.
