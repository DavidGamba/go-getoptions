= New Project Templates

== Single Purpose Script

When creating a new single purpose script (in other words, with no sub-commands) use the template below:

include::script/script.go[]

The template has a single `os.Exit`.
`os.Exit` shouldn't be used anywhere else on your script (otherwise defer statements will not run).

The template ensures your script exits with 0 for success, 1 for error.
If there is a need for a custom exit status code, the error returned from `realMain` should be checked and the logic implemented there.

The template also creates a default context that captures `os.Interrupt`, `syscall.SIGHUP` and `syscall.SIGTERM`.

== Complex Script

When creating a complex tool (in other words, one that implements sub-commands) use the template below:

include::complex/complex.go[]

The template has a single `os.Exit`.
`os.Exit` shouldn't be used anywhere else on your script (otherwise defer statements will not run).

The template ensures your script exits with 0 for success, 1 for error.
If there is a need for a custom exit status code, the error returned from `realMain` should be checked and the logic implemented there.

The template also creates a default context that captures `os.Interrupt`, `syscall.SIGHUP` and `syscall.SIGTERM`.

The template doesn't run any code at the top level command other than displaying the help.

Finally, the template has an example command (`cmd`) with an example implementation (`Run`).
