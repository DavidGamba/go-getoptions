== v0.17.0: Breaking Changes

As the releases before, this release has 100% test coverage.

This release keeps on the work of removing the kinks around subcommands.
An example showing subcommands can be found in https://github.com/DavidGamba/go-getoptions/tree/master/examples/mygit[./examples/mygit].

It also introduces the use of context to propagate cancelation signals, etc. to the child commands.

Finally, it introduces a new helper that captures interrupts (for example Ctrl-C) and returns a top level context.

=== Breaking changes

* Refactor `NewCommmand` as a method.
This will allow the built-in help to have information about the parent.
It might also help with autocompletion.

* Change sigature to `opt.NewCommand(name, description string)`.
It takes a name and description now.

* Change signature of `CommandFn` to have a `context` as the first argument.
It will allow the parent to propagate cancelation signals, etc. to the child commands.
This change goes along a change to the helper `opt.Dispatch` to also have a `context` as the first argument.

----

=== New Features

* Introduce `opt.InterruptContext()`, a helper that returns a top level context that captures interrupt signals (`os.Interrupt`, `syscall.SIGHUP`, `syscall.SIGTERM`).
An example can be found in https://github.com/DavidGamba/go-getoptions/tree/master/examples/mygit[./examples/mygit].

== v0.16.0 Feature release

As the releases before, this release has 100% test coverage.

=== Fixes

* Bug Fix: Update `opt.Dispatch` not to handle `--help` option.
It was preventing the help option to reach the commands.

=== New Features

* Introduce `opt.HelpSynopsisArgs(string)` method to allow overriding the default args description.
The current default description is `[<args>]`.

=== Minor changes

* Make `SetMode`, `SetUnknownMode`, `SetRequireOrder` and `SetMapKeysToLower` chainable.

== v0.15.0 Feature release

As the releases before, this release has 100% test coverage.

Change workflow to deal with ambiguities between parent and child.

For example, the root may have option `--profile` and the command the option `--password` with alias `-p`. If `-p` is passed, the parent would uncorrectly be matched.

For the parent to properly handle ambiguities with its children, it needs to have knowledge of them. A new `getoptions.NewCommand` has been introduced.

To help with the verbosity of handling all the commands, a new `Dispatch` method is introduced, it will call a command's function defined with the new `SetCommandFn` method.

=== New Features

• Introduce `getoptions.NewCommand()` to declare commands and clearly separate their role from the main `getoptions.New()`.

• Introduce `command.SetCommandFn(fn CommandFn)` to declare a commands function callback.

• Introduce `opt.Dispatch(helpOptionName string, args []string)` to automatically handle dispatching to the `CommandFn` based on the cli input.

• Make options unambiguous with commands.
For example, the root may have option `--profile` and the command the option `--password` with alias `-p`. If `-p` is passed, the parent would uncorrectly be matched.

• Introduce new error indicating which options are getting matched with ambiguous options.

• Add `getoptions.HelpCommand()` to have an automated help command.
It adds completions for all other commands automatically.

=== Minor changes

• Fix unknown option warning formatting.
Each warning has its own line and it is preceded by `WARNING: `.

• Minor README updates... New features need proper documentation.

• Minor automated help changes.

== v0.14.1 Golang Bug fix: module install error

Bypass double dot golang modules error:
https://github.com/golang/go/issues/27299

== v0.14.0 Breaking Changes

As the releases before, this release has 100% test coverage.

This release introduces bash completion by default and works out many kinks around subcommands.
An example showing subcommands can be found in https://github.com/DavidGamba/go-getoptions/tree/master/examples/mygit[./examples/mygit].

=== Breaking changes

• Remove support for Go < v1.10 (v1.5 - v1.9).
• Rename `getoptions.Option` to `getoptions.Value`.
+
WARNING: A new `getoptions.Option` method is has been introduced, but the new one returns `*option.Option` instead.

• Change the argument of `opt.SetMode` and `opt.SetUnknownMode` from a string to a `getoptions.Mode` and `getoptions.UnknownMode` type.
Makes it easier to autodiscover valid arguments for the method.

• Refactor section help methods into the main `opt.Help` one.
+
[source, diff]
----
- opt.HelpName()
+ opt.Help(getoptions.HelpName)

- opt.HelpSynopsis()
+ opt.Help(getoptions.HelpSynopsis)

- opt.HelpCommandList()
+ opt.Help(getoptions.HelpCommandList)

- opt.HelpOptionList()
+ opt.Help(getoptions.HelpOptionList)
----
+
To print all the sections of the automated help, continue to use `opt.Help()`.

=== New Features

• Implement bash completion by default.
+
Add the following to your `.bashrc`: +
`complete -o default -C "/binary/location/myscript" myscript`

• New `getoptions.Option` method that returns `*option.Option`.
In combination with the new `getoptions.SetOption` it allows to pass options from parent to subcommand.

• Add `getoptions.CustomCompletion` method.
Given a list, it will add the elements of the list to the completion alternatives.

• Add `getoptions.StringMapVar` method.

=== Minor changes

• Pad SYNOPSIS content with 4 spaces.
• Add `Self` method to populate help NAME section.

=== Backend changes

• Refactor the code into more modular pieces.


== v0.13.0 Feature release

As the releases before, this release has 100% test coverage.

=== New Features

• Experimental implementation of help messages.
• Show used alias in errors for single options (not slice or maps).
• Add opt.CalledAs method to know how the option was called.

=== Minor changes

• Add example script.
• Add golang 1.12 to test suite.


== v0.12.0 Breaking Changes

As the releases before, this release has 100% test coverage.

=== Breaking change: Update function signatures

Change all function signatures from:

	XVar(p *bool, name string, def bool, aliases ...string)

To:

	XVar(p *bool, name string, def bool, fns ...ModifyFn)

This change allows to pass different functions to the option that will
modify single option behaviour and will allow for multiple features
without future breaking changes in the function signature.

As part as this change, a new function, `opt.Alias` is added to support
previous functionality.

To update, change the aliases from a list of aliases as the variadic
last argument to a list of aliases passed to the `opt.Alias` function.
For example:

[source, diff]
----
- opt.BoolVar(&flag, "flag", false, "f", "alias2")
+ opt.BoolVar(&flag, "flag", false, opt.Alias("f", "alias2"))
----

=== New Features

• Add `opt.Alias` option modifier to assign option aliases.
• Add `opt.Required` option modifier to indicate if an option is required.


== v0.11.0 Breaking Changes

As the releases before, this release has 100% test coverage.

=== Fix `go tip` case sensitive import path

	davidgamba -> DavidGamba

=== Deprecate and rename redundant methods

• `StringSlice` is redundant with `StringSliceMulti`.  +
Calling: +
`StringSlice(name, aliases...)` +
Is the same as Calling: +
`StringSliceMulti(name, 1, 1, aliases...)` +
Consolidate API to: +
`StringSlice(name, min, max, aliases...)`

• `StringMap` is redundant with `StringMapMulti`. +
Calling: +
`StringMap(name, aliases...)` +
Is the same as Calling: +
`StringMapMulti(name, 1, 1, aliases...)` +
Consolidate API to: +
`StringMap(name, min, max, aliases...)` +

• Rename `IntSliceMulti` to `IntSlice`.

=== New features

• Add `StringSliceVar` and `IntSliceVar` methods.
• Add option to `SetMapKeysToLower`.
